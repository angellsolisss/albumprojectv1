        <h3><span class="bold">Personal Notes</span></h3>
        <img src="csh.jfif" alt="Will Toledo" height="400px" class="imgRight">
        <p>Car Seat Headrest is a band I didn't like at all when I first listened to them, I thought the lead singer's voice was annoying which seemed like that was it for me 
            being able to enjoy them, but I listened to them a year later and was completely blown away by Twin Fantasy (Specifically the 2018 remaster). I have never heard any song or consumed
            any type of media for that fact, that has a similar writing style to how Will Toledo writes his songs on this album, I can't put into words what it is about the songwriting and that's 
            most likely what makes it so good to me. Each and every song makes me feel a specific type of comforting sadness, maybe somber is a better word, yet again it is so hard to put my feelings about this album into words. 
            There are multiple 10+ minute long songs on this record that just fly by and feel like they took all of 2 minutes to go by, which is just another testament to how good Toledo's songwriting is, 
            not a single moment is wasted on this album, it's just an hour and 11 minutes of the inner workings of a furry who is going through a breakup.</p>
        <h3>Overall Score: 10/10</h3>
