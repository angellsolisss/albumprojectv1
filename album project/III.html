        <img src="cciii.jfif" alt="Alice Glass" height="400px" class="imgRight">
        <p>There was a time when I thought this album was better than II, but that was in 2021. Compared to II, this album has more misses and doesn't have Robert Smith on it (I am insanely biased towards anything The Cure 
            related). With that being said, III is still a crazy good album that has the same effect as any other of the initial three Crystal Castles albums, that being that the songs sound incredibly cold and evil at times, but you can't 
            help but move and dance to them. III is a baseline Crystal Castles album, it's not their best work, it is not their worst, but what it happens to be is a 40-minute bad trip in a club that is freezing and wet and you
            want to leave immediately, but the music is good so you stick around and dance. What more could one possibly want out of a Crystal Castles album.
        </p>
        <h3>Overall Score: 8.8/10</h3>
