        <img src="theStrokes(4).png" alt="The Strokes" height="400px" class="imgRight">
        <p>The Strokes by no means had a sophomore slump with their second studio album, but it just doesn't resonate with me as much as Is This It. If anything, it's super impressive how with the pressure of 
            all these music magazines hailing them as the saviors of rock and roll, they were still able to put out such a good record. They bring some of that douchebag charm that was present on Is This It on tracks 
            like 12:51, Automatic Stop, and Meet Me in the Bathroom which is always nice, but as previously mentioned it just doesn't hit as hard as Is This It does for me. What I will always find silly about this album 
            is how much of a jumpscare the beginning of The End Has No End is if you happen to be listening at any volume that's above 50%, speaking of that, this album is full of 3-4 second long "intros" where there's just no 
            audio which I've always found annoying. Maybe that's why I don't rank this album as high as Is This It.
        </p>
        <h3>Overall Score: 9.3/10</h3>
