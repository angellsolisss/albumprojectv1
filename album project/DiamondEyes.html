        <h3><span class="bold">Personal Notes</span></h3>
        <img src="Deftones.jfif" alt="Chino Moreno" height="400px" class="imgRight">
        <p>I am an absolute sucker for the percussion sounds and vocals of Deftones, and Diamond Eyes is where both of those elements are at their best across the band's discography in my opinion.
            As opposed to their earlier work, the majority of Diamond Eyes consists of Chino Moreno singing more traditionally and less of him screaming, his screaming style of singing is good too, but I cannot
            get enough of the way the vocals are layered on top of one another to create harmonies, those harmonies mixed with deep, thick riffs and a drumset that is tuned beautifully make my ears happy whenever this album comes on. 
            It's bittersweet that this record along with Koi No Yokan (2012) and White Pony (2000) are where the group peaked, but I couldn't be more overjoyed that their peak was this astronomically high.
        </p>
        <h3>Overall Score: 9/10</h3>
