        <img src="ccii.jfif" alt="Alice Glass" height="400px" class="imgRight">
        <p>Similarly to why I like Seventeen Seconds so much, II sets you smack dab in the middle of a cemetery that just so happens to be occupied by 
            a Canadian woman screaming into a microphone. There were so many phony Crystal Castles copycats after the releases of their 3 main albums (I, II, and III)
            but none of them have mastered the witch house, electro-punk sound just as well as Alice Glass has. Adding onto everything that I adore about this album, 
            Crystal Castles somehow got Robert Smith to feature on Not In Love which is so sick to me, the thought of the lead singer of The Cure collaborating with 
            an electronic group with such a specific sound is super cool to me and I wonder how they managed to get it done. Another aspect of this album that I find 
            intriguing is that it was recorded in really odd locations like an abandoned church in Iceland, a self-built cabin in Ontario, a garage behind an abandoned drugstore in Detroit, as well 
            as normal recording studios, which is the most Crystal Castles thing ever. The effort to willingly make themselves uncomfortable to achieve that genuine cold sound is perfect.
        </p>
        <h3>Overall Score: 9.1/10</h3>
