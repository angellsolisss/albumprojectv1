        <img src="nhm.jfif" alt="Alice Glass" height="400px" class="imgRight">
        <p>I have a weird relationship with Neutral Milk Hotel, before to recognizing On Avery Island as one of my favorite albums, I thought the record they released prior, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, was phenomenal. The more I listened
            to In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, I started to like it less and less and my opinion of it changed. So far I've had nothing but negative things to say about this band, but On Avery Island is the epitome of what a Neutral
            Milk Hotel album should be, it has the perfect mix of folkiness and guitars being amplified by what sound like 20-dollar amps found at the back of a goodwill. On top of all that, the songwriting is superb. When I listen to 
            this record, I get hints of what I feel when I listen to Car Seat Headrest, the lyrics being as peculiar as they are mixed with Jeff Magnum's raw vocals are very Car Seat Headrestesque which might be silly of me to declare since 
            Neutral Milk Hotel has been around for way longer than Toledo and them. There's a shared charm between the two bands that I have yet to find in any other group, and yet again this charm isn't something that I can put into words, 
            but rather something I can identify when I hear it.
