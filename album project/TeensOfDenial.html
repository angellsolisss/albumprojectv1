        <h3><span class="bold">Personal Notes</span></h3>
        <img src="csh2.jfif" alt="Car Seat Headrest" height="400px" class="imgRight">
        <p>This one youtube video I watched a while ago about Teens of Denial sums up my thoughts if it perfectly. This album is awesome but not as good as Twin Fantasy. The main reason it isn't as good in my opinion is that the issues that 
            Will Toledo on this record sings about are too relatable and not that abstract compared to his other work, which might sound silly, but what makes Car Seat Headrest so special to me is that Toledo writes about his problems in a way that allows the listener to hear them as if they are in his mind. None of the 
            lyrics are dumbed down so that the listener can understand, rather they are sung with no filter and it is up to us to interpret them. On Teens of Denial, a lot of the material can be interpreted pretty easily which is fine like I said, but a part of me misses the 
            ambiguity of what was being sung about on other Car Seat Headrest records. Despite all this, I still enjoy Teens of Denial enough to rank it a 9/10 and the songs still scratch an itch in my brain regardless of whatever way I feel about the songwriting. That is how 
            much I enjoy this silly little band. 
        </p>
        <h3>Overall Score: 9/10</h3>
